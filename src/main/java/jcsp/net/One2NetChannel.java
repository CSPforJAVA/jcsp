    * Output data to this channel.  The data must be Serializable.
    * <p>
    * For a normal channel (numUnacknowledged == 0), the contract of this
    * method is as follows:  When the method returns, the data has been sent
    * to the remote computer, and the process (or user-supplied buffer) at
    * the other end has accepted it.  It is safe to modify <tt>data</tt>
    * after the call.  Transmission is guaranteed unless a
    * LinkLostException is thrown, in which case it is impossible to
    * determine whether or not the remote computer recieved the data
    * before the link dropped.
    * <p>
    * For a streaming channel (numUnacknowledged > 0), the contract of
    * this method is slightly different.  When the method returns, the data
    * has started it's trip to the remote computer, but the link may go down
    * so there is no guarantee that it will get there.  Also, since it may
    * not have left this computer yet (the actual transmission is done in
    * parallel with the return from this method), it is *NOT* safe to modify
    * the passed <tt>data</tt> object.  After the <i>next</i> call to this
    * method, then you may assume that the <tt>data</tt> object has been
    * transmitted, and re-use it or let the Java garbage collector deal with
    * it as appropriate.  You must wait a total of <tt>numUnacknowledged</tt>
    * calls to this method before you can assume that the data was recieved
    * - and if any of those calls throw a LinkLostException, then you
    * cannot find out how much of the stream of data was recieved by the
    * remote computer before the link broke.
    * <p>
    * A LinkLostException is thrown if the TCP/IP link is dropped.
    * This could be due to a network problem, but more often it is caused
    * when the remote Java VM crashes or is shut down.  It can also be
    * caused if there is a serialization problem with the TCP/IP link - e.g.
    * an attempt to send a non-serializable object, or an attempt to send a
    * class which doesn't exist or isn't the same version at the recieving
    * end.  Note that LinkLostException is a permanent error - if it
    * is thrown, then any further call to this method will cause it to be
    * thrown again.
