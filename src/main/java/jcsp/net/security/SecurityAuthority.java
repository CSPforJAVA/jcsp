/**
 * <p>Defines the service for dealing with authenticating users via a challenge/response scheme. Currently
 * only one user may be logged onto the security authority at any one time. The currently logged on user
 * will be used for creating the responses to challenges. Any number of users may be regarded as 'permitted'
 * and any response from one of these will be considered valid.</p>
 *
 * <p>An instance of the security authority service can be used to generate concrete user IDs and tokens
 * when users log on. This might be a purely internally resolved scheme or perhaps be linked to information
 * from a system level domain (eg the user's logon account).</p>
 *
 * <p>To negotiate starting a link, the security authorities at each end should create challenges to send.
 * The peer nodes will create responses from these challenges which indicate the log in of the user at that
 * node. The security authority creating the challenge can then be used to validate the response determining
 * whether the user generating the response is permitted to connect to this node.</p>
 *
 * <p>For example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *        // Node 1                                           // Node 2
 * SecurityAuthority sa = ...;                         SecurityAuthority sa = ...;
 *
 * Challenge c = sa.createChallenge ();                // receive a challenge 'c' and send the response
 * // send 'c' to the other node and receive 'r'       Challenge c = ...;
 * Response r = ...;                                   Response r = sa.createResponse (c);
 *
 * if (sa.validateResponse (c, r)) {
 *   // access is permitted
 * } else {
 *   // access is denied
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>To set the current user, ie the one which will create the response, use the <code>logonUser</code>
 * method. Obtaining a concrete user token is the responsibility of the concrete implementation. Similarly
 * creating the user IDs is the responsibility of the concrete implementation. No methods are defined in
 * this interface for these purposes because the number of parameters may vary depending on how users
 * authenticate. For example they may supply a username/password pair, just a username string
 * in a weaker system, or perhaps other, non-string credentials.</p>
 *
 * <p>To set the users which are currently permitted, ie will be considered to have generated a valid
 * response the <code>permitUserAccess</code> method must be used. To remove a user from this set the
 * <code>denyUserAccess</code> method should be used.</p>
