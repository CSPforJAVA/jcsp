/**
 * <p>
 * This class is the Channel Name Server's main client process class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * One instance of this class needs to be instantiated at each Node wishing
 * to interact with a Channel Name Server.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * At present only one instance of this service class should be installed at
 * each Node, however, it is envisaged that it may be desirable to be able to
 * use multiple Channel Name servers. This functionality has been partially
 * implemented and eventually multiple instances of this service will be able
 * to be installed.  Each instance would be given a separate name.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A default instance of this class can be held. Interaction with this
 * default instance is facilitated through the static methods of
 * the {@link CNS} class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Once constructed, an instance of the object can be installed into the
 * Node's service manager in the same way as any other <code>Service</code>
 * (see <code>{@link ServiceManager}</code>).
 * Alternatively, the one of the static install methods may be used
 * (see <code>{@link CNSService#install(NodeKey, NodeAddressID)}</code>,
 * <code>{@link CNSService#install(NodeKey, NodeAddressID, String)}</code>).
 * </p>
