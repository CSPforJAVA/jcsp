This document is the specification for the JCSP core API.
<P>
JCSP provides a complete library for building complex functionality
through layered networks of communicating processes.  It conforms to
the <A HREF="http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/archive/csp.html">CSP</A>
model of cummunicating systems so that twenty years of theory, tools
and practical experience can be brought to bear in the support of Java
multi-threaded applications.
Newcomers to JCSP should start with the documentation on
the {@link jcsp.lang.CSProcess <TT>CSProcess</TT>} interface,
which outlines and motivates the notion of <I>components</I> as <I>communicating processes</I>
and the <I>process oriented design</I> pattern.
<P>
Processes interact solely via CSP synchronising primitives, such as
{@link jcsp.lang.Channel <I>channels</I>}
<i>(</i>{@link jcsp.lang.One2OneChannel <I>one-to-one</I>},
{@link jcsp.lang.Any2OneChannel <I>any-to-one</I>},
{@link jcsp.lang.One2AnyChannel <I>one-to-any</I>},
{@link jcsp.lang.Any2AnyChannel <I>any-to-any</I>}<i>)</i>,
{@link jcsp.lang.One2OneCallChannel <I>CALL channels</I>},
{@link jcsp.lang.CSTimer <I>timers</I>},
{@link jcsp.lang.Crew <I>crews</I>},
{@link jcsp.lang.Barrier <I>barriers</I>},
{@link jcsp.lang.AltingBarrier <I>alting barriers</I>},
{@link jcsp.lang.Bucket <I>buckets</I>}
or other well-defined modes of access
to shared passive objects.  Processes do not invoke each other's methods.
Processes may be combined to run in {@link jcsp.lang.Sequence <I>sequence</I>}
or {@link jcsp.lang.Parallel <I>parallel</I>}.  Processes may be combined to wait passively
on a number of {@link jcsp.lang.Alternative <I>alternative</I>} events, with one of them
trigered into action only by the external generation of that event.
Such collections of events may
be serviced either {@link jcsp.lang.Alternative#fairSelect() <I>fairly</I>}
(guaranteeing no starvation of one event by the repeated arrival of its siblings),
by any user-defined {@link jcsp.lang.Alternative#priSelect() <I>priority</I>} or
in an {@link jcsp.lang.Alternative#select() <I>arbitrary</I>} manner.
<P>
JCSP is an alternative to the built-in
<I>monitor</I> model for Java threads.  JCSP primitives should not normally
be mixed into designs with <TT>synchronized</TT> method declarations, instances
of the <TT>java.lang.Runnable</TT> interface or <TT>java.lang.Thread</TT> class,
or invocations of the <TT>wait</TT>/<TT>notify</TT>/<TT>notifyAll</TT>
methods from <TT>java.lang.Object</TT>.
<P>
However, JCSP is compatible with the built-in model and, with care, can be mixed
safely and profitably.  In particular, process communication via <TT>wait</TT>-free
<TT>synchronized</TT> method invocations on a shared passive object directly
implements a common CSP <I>server</I> idiom
(see {@link jcsp.awt.DisplayList <TT>DisplayList</TT>} for an example).
Further, existing libraries that interact with user software via <I>listener</I>
registration and callback (such as the standard <I>AWT</I> and <I>Swing</I>) can be
easily tailored to operate as processes with channel-based interfaces (for
example, see {@link jcsp.awt <I>jcsp.awt</I>}).
<P>
Finally, we note that the JCSP library reflects
the <A HREF="http://occam-pi.org/"><B>occam-pi</B></A>
realisation of CSP and pi-calculus.,
An <B>occam-pi</B> <TT>PROC</TT> declaration maps simply into a class implementing
{@link jcsp.lang.CSProcess <TT>CSProcess</TT>}, whose constructor parameters mirror the <TT>PROC</TT>
parameters and whose <TT>run</TT> method mirrors the <TT>PROC</TT> body.

This is the original exposition of CSP.  Presentation is largely from the
programmer's point of view.  The <B>Ada</B> tasking model and the
<B>occam</B>/transputer process model were derived from this work.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is <I>`the book'</I>.  Presentation is more abstract (i.e. mathematical)
and a more general theory is given than in the original CACM paper.
One crucial difference is that <I>events</I> (and <I>channels</I>)
become concepts that are separate from the processes that engage in
them.  This difference was adopted in the <B>occam</B>/transputer
model, but <B>Ada</B> missed out on it.  The <I>JCSP</I> library
follows the model presented in this book.

This gives a crisp, amusing and accurate tour around all the CSP concepts,
strongly recommended for beginners and experienced CSP users alike.
[Actually only up to (and including) page 11 are for normal mortals - after
that it starts to get scary.  But those first few pages are a gem.]

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is a tutorial introduction to the Java monitor model.
It raises concern over its ease of use and the safety of its standard
design patterns, but shows how it may be used to build
the CSP primitives.  Finally, it revisits those concerns and shows
how they fade in the light of CSP.

<H2>Request for Feedback</H2>
Currently, the more complex the system requirements, the less likely it becomes
that concurrency (or multi-threading) play a major role.  This is because
concurrency is thought to make system design especially hard - so many additional
problems (race hazards, deadlock etc.) to worry about.
A good model of concurrency, however, should <I>simplify</I> the design,
implementation, verification and maintenance of systems.  A design goal
for our <I>CSP-for-Java</I> collaboration is to enable concurrency to play
that natural role.  <A HREF="mailto:jcsp-team@ukc.ac.uk">Feedback</A>
on moving towards that goal is always welcome.
<P>
