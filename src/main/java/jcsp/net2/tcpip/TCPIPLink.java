/**
 * A concrete implementation of a Link that operates over a TCP/IP based socket connection. For information on Link, see
 * the relative documentation.
 * <p>
 * It is perfectly possible for a user to create a TCPIPLink without going through the standard LinkFactory approach,
 * although this is not recommended. For example:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * TCPIPLink link = new TCPIPLink(address);<br>
 * link.connect();
 * link.registerLink();<br>
 * new ProcessManager(link).start();<br>
 * </code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Can be achieved using the LinkFactory:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * link = LinkFactory.getLink(address);
 * </code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The LinkFactory will create and start the Link automatically if required.
