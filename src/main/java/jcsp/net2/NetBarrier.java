/**
 * This class is a networked implementation of the standard JCSP Barrier.
 * <p>
 * The NetBarrier is a networked version of the JCSP Barrier, a synchronization primitive similar to the standard event
 * in CSP. The networked implementation follows the standard interface for a local Barrier, with the addition of the
 * interface defining a networked construct. Internally, the two constructs behave differently due to the distributed
 * nature of the NetBarrier.
 * </p>
 * <H3>Client and Server Ends</H3>
 * <p>
 * Unlike a normal Barrier, a NetBarrier has two types, based on whether the Barrier is the hosting end or an attached,
 * synchronizing end. These are differentiated between as server and client ends. The server end, like the input end of
 * a networked channel, will be declared first. The location of this server end can then be used to connect a number of
 * client ends to. The server end can declare an initial number of expected client ends, which it waits for enrolls from
 * before beginning any sync operations. This value can be set to 0 if need be. Each end of a barrier must also declare
 * the number of local syncing processes, creating a two tier construct:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Process ---> NetBarrier (client) ---> NetBarrier (server)
 * </p>
 * <H3>Creating NetBarriers</H3>
 * <p>
 * To create a NetBarrier, a similar method is used as a networked channel. A Barrier Name Server is provided for
 * declaring named barriers, or the NetBarrierEnd factory can be used. First, creation of a sever end:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * int locallyEnrolled = 5;<br>
 * int remoteEnrolled = 1;<br>
 * NetBarrier bar = NetBarrierEnd.netBarrier(locallyEnrolled, remoteEnrolled);<br>
 * </code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A client end requires the location of this barrier to allow creation:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * NetBarrierLocation loc;<br>
 * int locallyEnrolled = 5;<br>
 * NetBarrier bar = NetBarrierEnd.netBarrier(loc, locallyEnrolled);<br>
 * </code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * These barriers can then be used as normal.
 * </p>
 * <H3><B>IMPLMENTATION NOTE</B></H3>
 * <p>
 * To save on resources, a NetBarrier does not have an internal process controlling it (although other implementations
 * may decide to do this). Because of this, the declaring (server) end of the barrier must always have at least one
 * process enrolled with it to ensure that the SYNC operation occurs. If there is a danger that the enrolled processes
 * on the server node will become 0, it is safer to define a process that is only responsible for SYNCing with the
 * barrier. This minor overhead in certain circumstances is seen as a better approach than all NetBarriers being a
 * process within JCSP, where processes are expensive in resources.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * public void run() { <br>
 *  while (true) { <br>
 *      bar.sync(); }} <br>
 * </code>
