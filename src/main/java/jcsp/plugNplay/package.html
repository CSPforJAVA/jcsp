This provides an assortment of <I>plug-and-play</I> CSP components to wire together
(with <TT>Object</TT>-carrying wires) and reuse.
Primarilly they are for education and demonstration purposes, but some
have value for general applications (e.g. {@link jcsp.plugNplay.Delta},
{@link jcsp.plugNplay.DynamicDelta}, {@link jcsp.plugNplay.Plex}, {@link jcsp.plugNplay.Multiplex}, {@link jcsp.plugNplay.Demultiplex},
{@link jcsp.plugNplay.ProcessRead}, {@link jcsp.plugNplay.ProcessWrite}, ...).
<P>
The educational purpose is to demonstrate how simple it is to build layered
networks of communicating processes.  Each component works to a clean channel
interface.  Component instances can just be wired together.  A network of
such components is itself another (CSP) component.  Network design
and analysis takes place independently at each level - we do not have to think
about the whole network hierarchy to reason about each level.  This enables us
to construct components with arbitrarilly rich behaviour without running into
combinatorial explosions of complexity.
<P>
Examples are given of networks with 20-30 processes (threads).  Because of
the component layering, we never need to consider more than about 5 at a time
and it is easy to see what they do and that they are without deadlock, livelock,
starvation or race-hazard problems.
